# Annotated markdown links for context engineering

A regular markdown link tells an agent where to go, but not why the file matters.

I use annotated links: each link is accompanied by a short semantic description of the target file.

## Format

Working convention:

- square brackets contain an absolute path from project root;
- parentheses contain the relative working path;
- then a short description from the target file `description`.

Example:

```md
[.memory-bank/product.md](../memory-bank/product.md): Product goals, constraints, and prioritization criteria.
```

## Why it matters

Annotated links make read/skip decisions faster:

- read now if relevant;
- postpone if secondary;
- skip if out of scope.

Without descriptions, agents guess from filenames and produce noisier context.

## Why absolute paths in link text

In long-running workflows, agents often lose track of the current directory. Absolute paths reduce navigation mistakes and keep references consistent.

## Bottom line

It is a tiny markdown convention, but it significantly improves context routing quality.
