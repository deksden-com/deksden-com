# Index files (index.md) for memory banks

In large memory-bank folders, a plain file list is often not enough: an agent can see filenames but still does not understand what each document contains.

That is why I keep dedicated `index.md` files in key directories (`architecture/`, `guides/`, `epics/`) with short descriptions for each file.

## What goes into index.md

- file list for the folder;
- one or two sentence description per file;
- descriptions sourced from frontmatter `description`;
- optional multi-level overview for deep folder trees.

## Why this helps

Without an index, the agent must:

- open many files blindly;
- guess from filenames;
- or rely on keyword search and risk missing the right file.

With a good index, agents can quickly decide what to read and what to skip. That saves tokens, time, and orchestrator context budget.

## How to keep indexes fresh

A practical workflow:

1. Assign a filesystem helper agent.
2. Run updates in parallel across major memory-bank branches.
3. For each file, update `description`, then regenerate `index.md`.
4. Add exclusions and custom rules for special directories.

This works better than a pure script when descriptions need semantic summarization.

## Bottom line

`index.md` is a small mechanism with a big impact on agent navigation quality.
